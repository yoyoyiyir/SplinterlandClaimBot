# splinterbots
A simple invetory tramsfer bot for Splinterlands. 
It's role is claim DEC, SPS and Cards and leter sent them to one master account.

There is no subscription for the bot, it is taking 1% of DEC and SPS on every transfer. 
I am still considering the level of the dev donation but it will never be larger than 1%. 

This bot is still work in progress, and as such some things might change. 
I have an idea to improve thte UI and onboarding process but it depends on the free time I will get.
